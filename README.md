# Hi, I’m Rachel!

## Currently learning...

I'm currently in the process of teaching myself CSS, HTML and JavaScript in preparation for a bootcamp in January 2022.

To help with this, I'm using _The Odin Project_ and a variety of online tutorials.

## Interested in...

I'm particularly interested in language and text processing. My main language is Python and my most recent project is a command-line [malaphor generator](https://github.com/rachel-meadows/malaphor).

In the process of working on this project, I also learned a little SQLite. At some point I plan to learn Django or Flask to make it accessible from the front end.

## My goals

I plan to complete a couple more projects (and read more textbooks) before starting the dev bootcamp.

I'm also planning on making a project site - so watch this space!
