# Hi, I’m Rachel!

## Currently learning...

I'm currently studying to be a full-stack developer at [**Enspiral Dev Academy**](https://devacademy.co.nz/), which I'll graduate from in **May 2022**.

Prior to that, I self-taught myself the basics of CSS, HTML, JavaScript and Python using [**Python For Everybody**](https://www.py4e.com/) and [**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Interested in...

I'm particularly interested in text processing and generation - check out my command-line [malaphor generator](https://github.com/rachel-meadows/malaphor)!

My background is in psychology with a focus on visual perception, so areas that intersect neuroscience and technology are also of interest to me.
