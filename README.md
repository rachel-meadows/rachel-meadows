# Hi, I‚Äôm Rachel!

_Note: As per tradition, this README is somewhat outdated, while my public projects are currently very outdated._

## üíª Where I'm at:
I'm a full-stack junior software engineer. In my day-to-day I work mostly with C# / .NET and SQL Server, but I have experience in React / Node.js as well and tend to use JavaScript for my personal projects.

Before starting work as a developer, I retrained at [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/), an intensive web development bootcamp. They taught technologies and skills such as:
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js and Express.js
- React and Redux 
- SQL using SQLite and Knex.js
- HTML5 & CSS3, and
- Test Driven Development using Jest and React Testing Library

Prior to the bootcamp, I was the Operations Manager of a SaaS edTech startup. I led a small team of designers and creatives, managed relationships with key stakeholders, and was responsible for researching many UX elements and product features.

## ü¶µ Where I'm going:

In my own time, I'm particularly interested in text processing and generation, horticultural / agricultural tech, and eLearning. I like making whimsical side projects because they're a fun way to try out something new in a low-stakes environment, and sometimes they incorporate these interests.

I recently started a blog, which you can read at https://rachelmeadows.substack.com.

My current priorities (outside of work and hobbies) are to tidy up my exceedingly-outdated portfolio, keep on blogging, and build some fun things with my recently-aquired arduinos and Raspberry Pi!
