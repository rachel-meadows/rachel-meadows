# Hi, I’m Rachel!

## Where I've come from:
I recently graduated from [**Enspiral Dev Academy**](https://devacademy.co.nz/), an intensive, 15-week web development bootcamp, where I learned technologies and skills such as:
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js and Express.js
- React and Redux 
- SQL using SQLite and Knex.js
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Test Driven Development (TDD) using Jest and React Testing Library
- Pair programming and Agile practices
- Distributed version control (Git and GitHub)

Prior to the bootcamp, I was the Operations Manager of a SaaS startup. I led a small team of designers and creatives, managed relationships with key stakeholders, and was responsible for researching many UX elements and product features.

## Where I'm going:

I'm particularly interested in text processing and generation, FinTech, horticultural / agricultural tech, and eLearning. I like both front-end and back-end development, but I have a definite soft spot for back-end development and this is where I'll be focusing most of my learning in the immediate future.

On my ever-growing list of technologies to learn, first in line are:
- C# and .NET
- TypeScript
- NoSQL

However, I'll be completing my portfolio and refactoring some old projects before I dive into these!
